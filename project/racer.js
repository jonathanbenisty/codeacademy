// Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

// Race number:

// Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
// All others receive a number below 1000.
// Start time:

// Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
// Early adults run at 9:30 am.
// Late adults run at 11:00 am.
// Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

let ageRunner = 18;

} else if (ageRunner > 18 && registeredEarly) {
  console.log(`The race for ${raceNumber} will start at 11:00 am`);
} else if (ageRunner < 18) {
  console.log(`The race for ${raceNumber} will start at 12:30 am`);
} else if (ageRunner ===18) {
   console.log(`The raceNumber ${raceNumber} would have to meet at the desk`);
